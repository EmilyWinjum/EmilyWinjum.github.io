            This assignment was a fun refresher in using unaugmented HTML.
            I didn't really learn a whole lot of new information, 
            but it was a nice reminder as I haven't worked with web-based 
            code in a while :)

            Aside from the information presented in lecture, I was fairly
            well versed in the construction of webpages and only needed
            to seek out new information in regards to adding unicode
            emojis to my blog.
