                            This assignment was a fun refresher in using unaugmented HTML. 
                            I didn't really learn a whole lot of new information, 
                            but it was a nice reminder as I haven't worked with web-based 
                            code in a while :)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Aside from the information presented in lecture, I was fairly 
                            well versed in the construction of webpages and only needed 
                            to seek out new information in regards to adding unicode 
                            emojis to my blog.

                                This assignment was a good excuse to flex the creative design
                                part of my skills and really dig my teeth into CSS. While I've
                                worked with it in the past, the experience of creating a website
                                like this was refreshing and fun!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For pretty much every bit of CSS that I did end up adding, W3 
                                schools was an incredibly useful web-resource. It gave me
                                significant insight into the usage and capabilites of various
                                CSS styles and attributes, and gave me a chance to explore
                                a lot of code that I haven't looked at in a while.
