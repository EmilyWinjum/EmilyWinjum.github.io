                            This assignment was a fun refresher in using unaugmented HTML. 
                            I didn't really learn a whole lot of new information, 
                            but it was a nice reminder as I haven't worked with web-based 
                            code in a while :)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Aside from the information presented in lecture, I was fairly 
                            well versed in the construction of webpages and only needed 
                            to seek out new information in regards to adding unicode 
                            emojis to my blog.

                            This assignment was a good excuse to flex the creative design
                            part of my skills and really dig my teeth into CSS. While I've
                            worked with it in the past, the experience of creating a website
                            like this was refreshing and fun!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For pretty much every bit of CSS that I did end up adding, W3 
                            schools was an incredibly useful web-resource. It gave me
                            significant insight into the usage and capabilites of various
                            CSS styles and attributes, and gave me a chance to explore
                            a lot of code that I haven't looked at in a while.

                            This assignment forced me to get more comfortable with manipulating
                            HTML elements with javascript, something I haven't really done much
                            of before! Specifically, I noticed that working with the DOM was
                            rather verbose relatively speaking. I am however glad that we were
                            required to use vanilla JS instead of an external library.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Any and all questions I had about javascript syntax, event handling,
                            the DOM, or various other problems I dealt with were solved either
                            in stack overflow, or W3 schools. I am glad to have looked more in
                            to using non-jquery code, and I feel that in general it has allowed
                            me to become more proficcient in my coding capabilities.
